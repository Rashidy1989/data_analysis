# ### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python.

# In[1]:


# This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers
(3*4)+5


# In[3]:


# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60
time_in_minutes = 200
time_in_hours = 200/60
print(time_in_hours)
